# odin-recipes

This is a simple recipe website, featuring 3 unique dishes.

Everything is made exclusively with HTML, using various tags like p to display text in paragraphs
or ul to display an unordered list. 

In this project, I have learned the basic structure of HTML, tags and creating/uploading my project on 
GitHub using Git.
